tmate-docker
============

Tmate.io docker server

Run it as a priviledged image, as tmate requires some special capabilitites: CLONE_NEWIPC and CLONE_NEWNET

If you want to build it:
```
docker build -t tmate-docker .
```

If you want to use it, and you built it:
```
sudo docker run --privileged -p 2222 -t tmate-docker
```

Or, if you just want to use it (without downloading and building it online) just do:
```
sudo docker run --privileged -p 2222 -t nicopace/tmate-docker
```

To know which port was tmate binded, run:
```
docker ps # this will show you the container id
docker port <container id> 2222
```

By default tmate-docker will bind inside the container on port 2222. This means that the ssh command that tmate will give you will include that port.
Sometimes you want to run on a different port. To do that you need to set the PORT environment variable, this will be the one that tmate will bind to inside the container.
For example:
```
docker run --privileged -e PORT=443 -p 443:443 -t nicopace/tmate-docker
```
